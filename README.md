#Functional JavaScript Programming
##### By Luis Atencio

##Since this code uses ES6 artifacts, you must transpile your JavaScript code with either:

* Babel
* Traceur

In this code repository you will find:

* All code samples (as runnable unit tests) of code used in chapters
* Sample application (Under Construction)
* Functional data types like Optional, Either, Maybe, etc
* Access to some JavaScript functional libraries like lodash.js, streams.js, bacon.js, etc.

##Libraries Requires
###QUnit
npm install qunit
